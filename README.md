# Visualize Data with a Scatterplot Graph

## freeCodeCamp Data Visualization Project
This is the second project for the fCC Data Visualization Certificate. I followed [Ganesh's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvtT4X2L9Fo) instructions again. The lesson tutorials in fCC were very limited, so it's really helpful to have clear instructions while I try to pick up on D3 setup, structure, methods, etc.
